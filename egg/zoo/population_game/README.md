(WIP) 

Transforming the encom_as_ssl game into the population experiment 
(for now we rely on encom_as_ssl to keep track of where the modifications are)
Generally --> Additional agents and additional architectures

short term goals :
* make measuring tools for individual agents (accuracy, and learning speed (graph and scalar))
* test that both the population game and the normal game yield the same results on a single pair game
* test with a listener and a speaker having different architectures

mid_term :
* nest needs to work on the UPF cluster (and on AWS)
* ...
